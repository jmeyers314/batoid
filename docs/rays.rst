Rays
====

The fundamental types in batoid are the `Ray` and `RayVector`.  These classes
represent either a single geometric ray, or a collection of rays.  These rays
can be generated, traced through optical systems, and then interrogated to
provide insight into PSFs, aberrations, vignetting, and more.
