        """Create RayVector on a parallelogram shaped region.

        This function will often be used to create a grid of rays on a square
        grid, but is flexible enough to also create grids on an arbitrary
        parallelogram, or even randomly distributed across an arbitrary
        parallelogram-shaped region.

        The algorithm starts by placing rays on the "stop" surface, and then
        backing them up such that they are in front of any surfaces of the
        optic they're intended to trace.

        The stop surface of most large telescopes is the plane perpendicular to
        the optic axis and flush with the rim of the primary mirror.  This
        plane is usually also the entrance pupil since there are no earlier
        refractive or reflective surfaces.  However, since this plane is a bit
        difficult to locate automatically, the default stop surface in batoid
        is the global x-y plane.

        If a telescope has a stopSurface attribute in its yaml file, then this
        is usually a good choice to use in this function.  Using a curved
        surface for the stop surface is allowed, but is usually a bad idea as
        this may lead to a non-uniformly illuminated pupil and is inconsistent
        with, say, an incoming uniform spherical wave or uniform plane wave.

        Parameters
        ----------
        optic : `batoid.Optic`, optional
            If present, then try to extract values for ``backDist``,
            ``medium``, ``stopSurface``, and ``lx`` from the Optic.  Note that
            values explicitly passed to `asGrid` as keyword arguments override
            those extracted from ``optic``.
        backDist : float, optional
            Map rays backwards from the stop surface to the plane that is
            perpendicular to the rays and ``backDist`` meters from the point
            (0, 0, z(0,0)) on the stop surface.  This should generally be set
            large enough that any obscurations or phantom surfaces occuring
            before the stop surface are now "in front" of the ray.  If this
            keyword is set to ``None`` and the ``optic`` keyword is set, then
            infer a value from ``optic.backDist``.  If both this keyword and
            ``optic`` are ``None``, then use a default of 40 meters, which
            should be sufficiently large for foreseeable telescopes.
        medium : `batoid.Medium`, optional
            Initial medium of each ray.  If this keyword is set to ``None`` and
            the ``optic`` keyword is set, then infer a value from
            ``optic.inMedium``.  If both this keyword and ``optic`` are
            ``None``, then use a default of vacuum.
        stopSurface : batoid.Interface, optional
            Surface defining the system stop.  If this keyword is set to
            ``None`` and the ``optic`` keyword is set, then infer a value from
            ``optic.stopSurface``.  If both this keyword and ``optic`` are
            ``None``, then use a default ``Interface(Plane())``, which is the
            global x-y plane.
        wavelength : float
            Vacuum wavelength of rays in meters.
        source : None or ndarray of float, shape (3,), optional
            Where rays originate.  If None, then rays originate an infinite
            distance away, in which case the ``dirCos`` kwarg must also be
            specified to set the direction of ray propagation.  If an ndarray,
            then the rays originate from this point in global coordinates and
            the ``dirCos`` kwarg is ignored.
        dirCos : ndarray of float, shape (3,), optional
            If source is None, then this indicates the initial direction of
            propagation of the rays.  If source is not None, then this is
            ignored.  Also see ``theta_x``, ``theta_y`` as an alternative to
            this keyword.
        theta_x, theta_y : float, optional
            Field angle in radians.  If source is None, then this indicates the
            initial direction of propagation of the rays.  If source is not
            None, then this is ignored.  Uses `utils.fieldToDirCos` to convert
            to direction cosines.  Also see ``dirCos`` as an alternative to
            this keyword.
        projection : {'postel', 'zemax', 'gnomonic', 'stereographic', 'lambert', 'orthographic'}, optional
            Projection used to convert field angle to direction cosines.
        nx, ny : int, optional
            Number of rays on each side of grid.
        dx, dy : float or (2,) array of float, optional
            Separation in meters between adjacent rays in grid.  If scalars,
            then the separations are exactly along the x and y directions.  If
            arrays, then these are interpretted as the primitive vectors for
            the first and second dimensions of the grid.  If only dx is
            explicitly specified, then dy will be inferred as a 90-degree
            rotation from dx with the same length as dx.
        lx, ly : float or (2,) array of float, optional
            Length of each side of ray grid.  If scalars, then these are
            measured along the x and y directions.  If arrays, then these also
            indicate the primitive vectors orientation of the grid.  If only
            lx is specified, then ly will be inferred as a 90-degree rotation
            from lx with the same length as lx.  If lx is ``None``, then first
            infer a value from ``nx`` and ``dx``, and if that doesn't work,
            infer a value from ``optic.pupilSize``.
        flux : float, optional
            Flux to assign each ray.  Default is 1.0.
        nrandom : None or int, optional
            If not None, then uniformly sample this many rays from
            parallelogram region instead of sampling on a regular grid.
        rng : None or int or `numpy.random.Generator`, optional
            Random number generator or seed to use for random sampling.

        This function can be used to regularly sample the entrance pupil of a
        telescope using polar symmetry (really, hexagonal symmetry).  Rings of
        different radii are used, with the number of samples on each ring
        restricted to a multiple of 6 (with the exception of a potential
        central "ring" of radius 0, which is only ever sampled once).  This may
        be more efficient than using a square grid since more of the rays
        generated may avoid vignetting.

        This function is also used to generate rays uniformly randomly sampled
        from a given annular region.

        The algorithm used here starts by placing rays on the "stop" surface,
        and then backing them up such that they are in front of any surfaces of
        the optic they're intended to trace.

        The stop surface of most large telescopes is the plane perpendicular to
        the optic axis and flush with the rim of the primary mirror.  This
        plane is usually also the entrance pupil since there are no earlier
        refractive or reflective surfaces.  However, since this plane is a bit
        difficult to locate automatically, the default stop surface in batoid
        is the global x-y plane.

        If a telescope has a stopSurface attribute in its yaml file, then this
        is usually a good choice to use in this function.  Using a curved
        surface for the stop surface is allowed, but is usually a bad idea as
        this may lead to a non-uniformly illuminated pupil and is inconsistent
        with, say, an incoming uniform spherical wave or uniform plane wave.

        Parameters
        ----------
        optic : `batoid.Optic`, optional
            If present, then try to extract values for ``backDist``,
            ``medium``, ``stopSurface``, and ``outer`` from the Optic.  Note
            that values explicitly passed to `asPolar` as keyword arguments
            override those extracted from ``optic``.
        backDist : float, optional
            Map rays backwards from the stop surface to the plane that is
            perpendicular to the ray and ``backDist`` meters from the point
            (0, 0, z(0,0)) on the stop surface.  This should generally be set
            large enough that any obscurations or phantom surfaces occuring
            before the stop surface are now "in front" of the ray.  If this
            keyword is set to ``None`` and the ``optic`` keyword is set, then
            infer a value from ``optic.backDist``.  If both this keyword and
            ``optic`` are ``None``, then use a default of 40 meters, which
            should be sufficiently large for foreseeable telescopes.
        medium : `batoid.Medium`, optional
            Initial medium of each ray.  If this keyword is set to ``None`` and
            the ``optic`` keyword is set, then infer a value from
            ``optic.inMedium``.  If both this keyword and ``optic`` are
            ``None``, then use a default of vacuum.
        stopSurface : batoid.Interface, optional
            Surface defining the system stop.  If this keyword is set to
            ``None`` and the ``optic`` keyword is set, then infer a value from
            ``optic.stopSurface``.  If both this keyword and ``optic`` are
            ``None``, then use a default ``Interface(Plane())``, which is the
            global x-y plane.
        wavelength : float
            Vacuum wavelength of rays in meters.
        outer : float
            Outer radius of annulus in meters.
        inner : float, optional
            Inner radius of annulus in meters.  Default is 0.0.
        source : None or ndarray of float, shape (3,), optional
            Where rays originate.  If None, then rays originate an infinite
            distance away, in which case the ``dirCos`` kwarg must also be
            specified to set the direction of ray propagation.  If an ndarray,
            then the rays originate from this point in global coordinates and
            the ``dirCos`` kwarg is ignored.
        dirCos : ndarray of float, shape (3,), optional
            If source is None, then this indicates the initial direction of
            propagation of the rays.  If source is not None, then this is
            ignored.  Also see ``theta_x``, ``theta_y`` as an alternative to
            this keyword.
        theta_x, theta_y : float, optional
            Field angle in radians.  If source is None, then this indicates the
            initial direction of propagation of the rays.  If source is not
            None, then this is ignored.  Uses `utils.fieldToDirCos` to convert
            to direction cosines.  Also see ``dirCos`` as an alternative to
            this keyword.
        projection : {'postel', 'zemax', 'gnomonic', 'stereographic', 'lambert', 'orthographic'}, optional
            Projection used to convert field angle to direction cosines.
        nrad : int
            Number of radii on which create rays.
        naz : int
            Approximate number of azimuthal angles uniformly spaced along the
            outermost ring.  Each ring is constrained to have a multiple of 6
            azimuths, so the realized value may be slightly different than
            the input value here.  Inner rings will have fewer azimuths in
            proportion to their radius, but will still be constrained to a
            multiple of 6.  (If the innermost ring has radius 0, then exactly
            1 ray, with azimuth undefined, will be used on that "ring".)
        flux : float, optional
            Flux to assign each ray.  Default is 1.0.
        nrandom : int, optional
            If not None, then uniformly sample this many rays from annular
            region instead of sampling on a hexapolar grid.
        rng : None or int or `numpy.random.Generator`, optional
            Random number generator or seed to use for random sampling.

        The function generates rays on a rings-and-spokes pattern, with a fixed
        number of radii for each azimuth and a fixed number of azimuths for
        each radius.  Its main use is for decomposing functions in pupil space

        annuli.  For more general purpose annular sampling, RayVector.asPolar()
        is often a better choice since it samples the pupil more uniformly.

        medium : `batoid.Medium`, optional
            Initial medium of each ray.  If this keyword is set to ``None`` and
            the ``optic`` keyword is set, then infer a value from
            ``optic.inMedium``.  If both this keyword and ``optic`` are
            ``None``, then use a default of vacuum.
        stopSurface : batoid.Interface, optional
            Surface defining the system stop.  If this keyword is set to
            ``None`` and the ``optic`` keyword is set, then infer a value from
            ``optic.stopSurface``.  If both this keyword and ``optic`` are
            ``None``, then use a default ``Interface(Plane())``, which is the
            global x-y plane.
        wavelength : float
            Vacuum wavelength of rays in meters.
        outer : float
            Outer radius of annulus in meters.
        inner : float, optional
            Inner radius of annulus in meters.  Default is 0.0.
        source : None or ndarray of float, shape (3,), optional
            Where rays originate.  If None, then rays originate an infinite
            distance away, in which case the ``dirCos`` kwarg must also be
            specified to set the direction of ray propagation.  If an ndarray,
            then the rays originate from this point in global coordinates and
            the ``dirCos`` kwarg is ignored.
        dirCos : ndarray of float, shape (3,), optional
            If source is None, then this indicates the initial direction of
            propagation of the rays.  If source is not None, then this is
            ignored.  Also see ``theta_x``, ``theta_y`` as an alternative to

        theta_x, theta_y : float, optional
            Field angle in radians.  If source is None, then this indicates the
            initial direction of propagation of the rays.  If source is not
            None, then this is ignored.  Uses `utils.fieldToDirCos` to convert
            to direction cosines.  Also see ``dirCos`` as an alternative to
            this keyword.
        projection : {'postel', 'zemax', 'gnomonic', 'stereographic', 'lambert', 'orthographic'}, optional
            Projection used to convert field angle to direction cosines.
        spokes : int or ndarray of float
            If int, then number of spokes to use.
            If ndarray, then the values of the spokes azimuthal angles in
            radians.
        rings : int or ndarray of float
            If int, then number of rings to use.
            If array, then the values of the ring radii to use in meters.
        spacing : {'uniform', 'GQ'}
            If uniform, assign ring radii uniformly between ``inner`` and
            ``outer``.
            If GQ, then assign ring radii as the Gaussian Quadrature points
            for integration on an annulus.  In this case, the ray fluxes will
            be set to the Gaussian Quadrature weights (and the ``flux`` kwarg
            will be ignored).
        flux : float, optional
            Flux to assign each ray.  Default is 1.0.

        """Create rays that intersects the "stop" surface at given points.

        The algorithm used here starts by placing the rays on the "stop"
        surface, and then backing them up such that they are in front of any
        surfaces of the optic they're intended to trace.

        The stop surface of most large telescopes is the plane perpendicular to
        the optic axis and flush with the rim of the primary mirror.  This
        plane is usually also the entrance pupil since there are no earlier
        refractive or reflective surfaces.  However, since this plane is a bit
        difficult to locate automatically, the default stop surface in batoid
        is the global x-y plane.

        If a telescope has a stopSurface attribute in its yaml file, then this
        is usually a good choice to use in this function.  Using a curved
        surface for the stop surface is allowed, but is usually a bad idea as
        this may lead to a non-uniformly illuminated pupil and is inconsistent
        with, say, an incoming uniform spherical wave or uniform plane wave.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x, y : ndarray
            X/Y coordinates on the stop surface where the rays would intersect
            if not refracted or reflected first.
        optic : `batoid.Optic`, optional
            If present, then try to extract values for ``backDist``,
            ``medium``, and ``stopSurface`` from the Optic.  Note that values
            explicitly passed here as keyword arguments override those
            extracted from ``optic``.
        backDist : float, optional
            Map rays backwards from the stop surface to the plane that is
            perpendicular to the rays and ``backDist`` meters from the point
            (0, 0, z(0,0)) on the stop surface.  This should generally be set
            large enough that any obscurations or phantom surfaces occuring
            before the stop surface are now "in front" of the ray.  If this
            keyword is set to ``None`` and the ``optic`` keyword is set, then
            infer a value from ``optic.backDist``.  If both this keyword and
            ``optic`` are ``None``, then use a default of 40 meters, which
            should be sufficiently large for foreseeable telescopes.
        medium : `batoid.Medium`, optional
            Initial medium of rays.  If this keyword is set to ``None`` and
            the ``optic`` keyword is set, then infer a value from
            ``optic.inMedium``.  If both this keyword and ``optic`` are
            ``None``, then use a default of vacuum.
        stopSurface : batoid.Interface, optional
            Surface defining the system stop.  If this keyword is set to
            ``None`` and the ``optic`` keyword is set, then infer a value from
            ``optic.stopSurface``.  If both this keyword and ``optic`` are
            ``None``, then use a default ``Interface(Plane())``, which is the
            global x-y plane.
        wavelength : float
            Vacuum wavelength of rays in meters.
        source : None or ndarray of float, shape (3,), optional
            Where the rays originate.  If None, then the rays originate an
            infinite distance away, in which case the ``dirCos`` kwarg must also
            be specified to set the direction of ray propagation.  If an
            ndarray, then the rays originates from this point in global
            coordinates and the ``dirCos`` kwarg is ignored.
        dirCos : ndarray of float, shape (3,), optional
            If source is None, then indicates the direction of ray propagation.
            If source is not None, then this is ignored.
        theta_x, theta_y : float, optional
            Field angle in radians.  If source is None, then this indicates the
            initial direction of propagation of the rays.  If source is not
            None, then this is ignored.  Uses `utils.fieldToDirCos` to convert
            to direction cosines.  Also see ``dirCos`` as an alternative to
            this keyword.
        projection : {'postel', 'zemax', 'gnomonic', 'stereographic', 'lambert', 'orthographic'}, optional
            Projection used to convert field angle to direction cosines.
        flux : float, optional
            Flux of rays.  Default is 1.0.
