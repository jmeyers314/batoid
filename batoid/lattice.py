class Lattice:
    """Container class for an ndarray + primitive lattice vectors.

    Used as the output type for several of the analysis algorithms, including
    PSFs and wavefronts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : ndarray, shape (N1, N2, ..., Nd)
        d-dimensional ndarray with dimensions N1, N2, ..., Nd
    primitiveVector : (d, d) ndarray
        Primitive lattice vectors.  E.g., primitiveVector[0] should contain the
        lattice vector for the first dimension.

    Notes
    -----
        The ``coords`` attribute will contain the coordinates of each lattice
        point determined by the coordinate index and the primitive lattice
        vectors.  E.g., in 2-dimensions

            lattice.coord[i, j] = (i - N1//2) * primitiveVector[0] + (j - N2//2) * primitiveVector[1]

        Note, this convention places

            lattice.coord[0,0] = (-N1//2) * primitiveVector[0] + (-N2/2) * primitiveVector[1]

        but the location of lattice.coord[-1,-1] depends on whether the size of
        each dimension is even or odd.  An odd-sized dimension is "centered", in
        that the 0-coordinate is precisely in the middle of the dimension.  An
        even-sized dimension will be slightly decentered, with more negative
        points than positive points.  The above convention is the same as for
        numpy.fft.fftfreq.
