    "### Rays\n",
    "The most fundamental object in batoid is the `Ray`, which you can roughly think of as a photon.  Rays are defined primarily by their position `r` and velocity vector `v`.  Positions in batoid are always specified in meters, and velocities are always in units of the speed of light in vacuum.  This makes the magnitude of the velocity vector equal to $1/n$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium in which the ray is currently propagating.  If you're just planning on geometrically tracing rays through reflective optics, then positions and velocities are the only required Ray parameters (and are the only required elements in the `Ray` constructors).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next most important `Ray` attribute after position and velocity is `wavelength`, which is (almost always) required for tracing through refractive optics.  (The exception is if you define a refractive medium that doesn't depend on wavelength.  Real media do have wavelength-dependent refractive indices of course.)  Ray wavelengths are always specified in meters, and always in vacuum -- even when the Ray being created isn't currently in vacuum.  If you don't specify a value for `wavelength` explicitly when constructing a `Ray`, a (somewhat nonsensical) value of 0.0 meters will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next in the list of `Ray` attributes is time `t`.  Batoid doesn't track time directly, but rather tracks the product of time and the speed of light in vacuum.  That product has dimensions of length, so time in batoid is measured in meters.  Note that this convention is complementary to the convention of tracking velocity in units of the speed of light in vacuum -- we still have the familiar relation $\\Delta \\vec{r} = \\vec{v} \\Delta t$.  The default value of time `t` for a `Ray` is 0.0 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final fundamental attributes of a `Ray` are a `flux` in arbitrary units and status indicators for whether a `Ray` has become `vignetted` during tracing, or if batoid `failed` to successfully trace a `Ray` for some reason.  These and a number of additional derived attributes will be discussed more below."
