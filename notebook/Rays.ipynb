    "### Rays\n",
    "The most fundamental object in batoid is the `Ray`, which you can roughly think of as a photon.  Rays are defined primarily by their position `r` and velocity vector `v`.  Positions in batoid are always specified in meters, and velocities are always in units of the speed of light in vaccuum.  This makes the magnitude of the velocity vector equal to $1/n$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium in question.  If you're just planning on geometrically tracing rays through reflective optics, then positions and velocities are the only required Ray parameters (and are the only required elements in the `Ray` constructors).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next most important `Ray` attribute after position and velocity is `wavelength`, which is (almost always) required for tracing through refractive optics.  (The exception is if you define a refractive medium that doesn't depend on wavelength.  Real media do have wavelength-dependent indices of course.)  Ray wavelengths are always specified in meters, and always in vaccuum -- even when the Ray being created isn't currently in vaccuum.  If you don't specify a value for `wavelength` explicitly when constructing a `Ray`, a (somewhat nonsensical) value of 0.0 meters will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next in the list of `Ray` attributes is time `t`.  Batoid doesn't track time directly, but rather tracks the product of time and the speed of light in vaccuum.  That product has dimensions of length, so time in batoid is measured in meters.  Note that this convention is complementary to the convention of tracking velocity in units of the speed of light in vaccuum -- we still have the familiar relation $\\Delta \\vec{r} = \\vec{v} \\Delta t$.  The default value of time `t` for a `Ray` is 0.0 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final fundamental attributes of a `Ray` are status indicators for whether a `Ray` has become `vignetted` during tracing, or if batoid `failed` to successfully trace a `Ray` for some reason.  These and a number of additional derived attributes will be discussed more below."

The `propagatedToTime` method is similar, but returns a new `Ray` object at the propagated position instead of the position itself.  Finally, the `propagateInPlace` method mutates the `Ray` in place, which is generally a little faster, but destroys the original `Ray`, of course.\n",

To help speed up this construction, batoid includes two convenience functions that can be used to rapidly create commonly desired grids of rays.

In both cases, the goal is to uniformly sample a plane wave incident upon some optical system by creating a grid of parallel and cophased `Ray`s.  For `rayGrid`, these assembled `Ray`s occupy a square region of space, and for `circularGrid`, they occupy a circular or annular region.  `RayVector`s assembled this way are the foundation for many of the analyses computable by batoid."
